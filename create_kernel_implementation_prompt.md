# Prompt: Create Kernel Implementation File

Create a Python file that implements a fused kernel operation in both PyTorch and Triton, with testing and benchmarking capabilities.

## Required Code Sections

### 1. PyTorch Implementation Section
```python
# <PYTHON>
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def fused_kernel_pytorch(params):
    """
    PyTorch implementation combining the specified operations
    """
    # Implement the fused operations here
    # Use the operations from your generated task
    pass
# </PYTHON>
```

### 2. Triton Implementation Section
```python
# <TRITON>
import torch
import triton
import triton.language as tl

@triton.jit
def fused_kernel_triton(params):
    """
    Triton fused kernel implementation
    """
    # Implement the fused operations here
    pass

def fused_kernel_triton_wrapper(params):
    """
    Wrapper for the Triton kernel
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
# </TRITON>
```

### 3. Testing Section
```python
# <TEST>
import torch
import time

def test_performance(pytorch_func, triton_func, inputs, num_runs=50):
    """Test performance of both implementations"""
    # Implementation here
    pass
# </TEST>
```

### 4. Main Execution Block
```python
# Main execution block
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Your main execution code here
    # Include attempt counting and comprehensive reporting
```

## Implementation Requirements

### PyTorch Implementation
- Must be functional and efficient
- Handle matrix dimensions correctly
- Implement the specific operations from your task

### Triton Implementation
- Use `@triton.jit` decorator
- Implement proper blocking strategy
- Handle memory access patterns correctly
- Include a wrapper function for easy calling

### Testing
- Generate appropriate test inputs
- Measure performance with timing
- Compare outputs between implementations
- Handle errors gracefully
- Run multiple iterations for accurate benchmarking

## Expected Output
The file should be executable and produce:
- Performance comparison between PyTorch and Triton
- Success/failure status for both implementations
- Timing measurements
- Clear attempt numbering
- Comprehensive reporting of results

## Key Features
- **Delimiters**: Use `<PYTHON>`, `<TRITON>`, and `<TEST>` tags
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of failures
- **Performance Testing**: Accurate benchmarking with multiple runs
- **Documentation**: Clear docstrings and comments

This file should contain everything needed to implement, test, and benchmark a fused kernel operation without requiring additional setup or external dependencies beyond PyTorch and Triton.
